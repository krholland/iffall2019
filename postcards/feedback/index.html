	<h1>Feedback for Rob</h1>
	<h2>Quote 1</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>For the desktop version, make the point size a little bigger, and also maybe move the quote down so that it doesn't line up with the window.</li>
			<li>The mobile version looks fine though</li>
		</ul>
	<h2>Quote 2</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I think both the mobile and desktop look good for this one.</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>Quote 3</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Increase point size on the desktop one and make the text 3 lines, also maybe bring the quote down a little bit</li>
			<li>Point size is also a little small to read on the mobile one, so if you can find a way to make it a little bigger but not have a lot of tension that would be good.</li>
		</ul>
