			<li>I'm Kirsten Holland, and I'm a junior majoring in Communication Design on the BFA track. I'm also double majoring in art history.</li>
			<li>I'm taking this class because it is a requirement for my major, but I am also genuinely interested in learning HTML and CSS, since it is really helpful to know as a designer.</li>
			<li>I do not have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
			<li>I hope to learn enough to be competent in doing some of my own web design/design for screens, and I want to be able to communicate with people who are coming from a coding perspective.</li>
			<li>I think the biggest difference is the way that designing for a screeen has a different potential for interactivity than designing for print does. There is almost a little bit less control on the design side because you have to account for the different types of screens and devices that are displaying the same thing, rather than, for instance, designing a printed poster that has specific dimensions that are viewed in a specific context you have more control of.</li>
			<li><a href="https://jingqi.work">https://jingqi.work</a> This portfolio website is effectively designed because it is really aesthetically appealing to look at, but the design still fits and enhances the viewing of the work it is meant to showcase.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com">https://www.amazon.com</a> While Amazon is not an incredibly beautiful website by any means, I have always found it easy to navigate, so in that way it exemplifies effective communication. All of the items Amazon sells are categorized in an intuitive way, and it is easy to search for things.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com">https://www.airbnb.com</a> Airbnb overall works well because it is visually designed well and nice to look at, but it is also really easy to navigate. It's a good example of the design being appropriate to the content.</li>
