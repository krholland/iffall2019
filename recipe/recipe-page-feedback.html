	<h1>Alec's feedback</h1>
	<div>
		<p>The images that happen in between the text has a very tight right margin. It lines up with the text on the right but maybe it could just be an even border for the images.</p>
		<p>Some orphan words for some of the directions. </p>
		<p>First image is a little pixelated.</p>

	<h1>Andriana's feedback</h1>
	<div>
		<p>More padding on your headers might be nice</p>
		<p>Perhaps have more spacing between sections (ingredients, instructions, etc) so that they group together</p>
		<p>Some more padding on the right of your blocks could be nice</p>
		<p>A slightly darker blue might read better</p>
