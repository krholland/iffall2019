				<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
				<div>Happiness hit her, like a train on a track</div>
				<div>Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back</div>
				<div>She hid around corners and she hid under beds</div>
				<div>She killed it with kisses and from it she fled</div>
				<div>With every bubble she sank with a drink</div>
				<div>And washed it away down the kitchen sink</div>
			</p>
			<p class="chorus-paragraph" id="chorusparagraph">
				<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
				<div>The dog days are over</div>
				<div>The dog days are done</div>
				<div>The horses are coming</div>
				<div>So you better run</div>
				<div>Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father</div>
				<div>Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers</div>
				<div>Leave all your love and your longing behind</div>
				<div>You can't carry it with you if you want to survive</div>
				<div>The dog days are over</div>
				<div>The dog days are done</div>
				<div>Can you hear the horses?</div>
				<div>'Cause here they come</div>
			</p>
			<p class="bridge-paragraph" id="bridgeparagraph">
				<strong>[Bridge]</strong>
				<div>And I never wanted anything from you</div>
				<div>Except everything you had</div>
				<div>And what was left after that too, oh</div>
			</p>
			<p class="verse-paragraph" id="verseparagraph2">
				<strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
				<div>Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back, back, back...</div>
				<div>Struck from a great height</div>
				<div>By someone who should know better than that</div>
