		<p>the images look good. Third image is kinda long an chunky in between the text so maybe a more horizontal imgage like the first two. </p>
		<p>The title could be larger</p>
		<p>Maybe the ingredients and insructions banners could be the same width as the text boxes</p>
		<p>Be more quirky!</p>

		<p>Notes to address feedback:</p> 
		<p>I'm going to make the title larger, make the images the same sizes/proportions, and ingredient and instruction banners the same width as the text boxes. Once I do that, I plan on styling my document further to add some more character.</p>
