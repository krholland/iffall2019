		<div>the images look good. Third image is kinda long an chunky in between the text so maybe a more horizontal imgage like the first two. </div>
		<div>The title could be larger</div>
		<div>Maybe the ingredients and insructions banners could be the same width as the text boxes</div>
		<div>Be more quirky!</div>

		<div>Notes to address feedback:</div> 
		I'm going to make the title larger, make the images the same sizes/proportions, and ingredient and instruction banners the same width as the text boxes. Once I do that, I plan on styling my document further to add some more character.
