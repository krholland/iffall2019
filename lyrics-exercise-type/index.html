			<p><strong>[Verse 1]</strong></p>
			<p>Happiness hit her, like a train on a track</p>
			<p>Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back</p>
			<p>She hid around corners and she hid under beds</p>
			<p>She killed it with kisses and from it she fled</p>
			<p>With every bubble she sank with a drink</p>
			<p>And washed it away down the kitchen sink</p>

			<p><strong>[Chorus]</strong></p>
			<p>The dog days are over</p>
			<p>The dog days are done</p>
			<p>The horses are coming</p>
			<p>So you better run</p>
			<p>Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father</p>
			<p>Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers</p>
			<p>Leave all your love and your longing behind</p>
			<p>You can't carry it with you if you want to survive</p>
			<p>The dog days are over</p>
			<p>The dog days are done</p>
			<p>Can you hear the horses?</p>
			<p>'Cause here they come</p>

		<section class="bridge-paragraph" id="bridgeparagraph">
			<p><strong>[Bridge]</strong></p>
			<p>And I never wanted anything from you</p>
			<p>Except everything you had</p>
			<p>And what was left after that too, oh</p>

		<section class="verse-paragraph" id="verseparagraph2">
			<p><strong>[Verse 2]</strong></p>
			<p>Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back, back, back...</p>
			<p>Struck from a great height</p>
			<p>By someone who should know better than that</p>
